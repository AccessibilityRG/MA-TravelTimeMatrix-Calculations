- Planning session for the Travel Time Matrix runs, autumn 2015 [See the Planning document] (Planning.md)


- Downloaded Digiroad 2015 (K) for 01_Uusimaa_1 , 01_Uusimaa_2 and 20_ita-Uusimaa


- Extracted Matix grid cells from the whole YKR grid (T11_gre_e_250m that was found under Aineistot\YKR\ETRS_TM35FIN_koordinaatisto\Ruudut\250m) --> 2014 version??? Should be the same as always..
- generated 1km buffer zone around the matrix extent and selected extra grid cells for the analysis: [see image] (Figures/MatrixExtentAndExtraCells.png)
- Merged the matrix grid cells and the extra cells (total number of grid cells=16085)
- Generated a list of YKR ID's (for the matrix, for the extra cells, and all together)
